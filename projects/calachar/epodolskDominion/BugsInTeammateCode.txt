Bugs found in Eric's Code

Running my tests I found a few bugs when going through the output files.

Most bugs were found by the game state checks I incorporated into my suite.
These checks store the number of cards in hand, discard, deck among other variables.
Then executes the function they are testing and comparing it with the expected value.
For example my random smithy test would take the cards in hand, use the smithy card, then see if the correct amount in hand remained after the function call.


The discard counts were wrong. I found these when the testing suite would test the game state.
The discard function itself is wrong and never truly updates the discard pile number and therefore always throws an error.

The smithy and adventurer tests also came back as errors. They had the incorrect number of cards in hand.
Also they did not correctly loop, I found this by going over the smithy function in his code.

The game score was also incorrect when I tested due to the program not correctly checking all zones in which point cards can exist.
